[DOCUMENTATION]

>> The TRACE method, while apparently harmless, can be successfully leveraged in some scenarios to steal legitimate users' credentials.

>> Tagging a cookie as httpOnly forbids JavaScript from accessing it, protecting it from being sent to a third party. However, the TRACE method can be used to bypass this protection and access the cookie even in this scenario.
